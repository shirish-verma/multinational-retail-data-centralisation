I had this issue pop up after reinstalling windows 10 due to an unrelated boot issue and reinstalling FH4.  Looking at my task manager, the Xbox services were trying to use the network but at very slow speeds (<0.1mbps) while the sync was stuck at 0%. When I checked the "Xbox Networking" app, under Xbox Live multiplayer, I was seeing NAT type displaying "Teredo is unable to qualify". I then used the "Fix It" button solution per this link which restored the NAT type value to "Moderate". That finally got the sync process to move ahead from 0.
However, the network speed used by the Xbox service is still only about 0.3mbps. So the sync process is moving along very slowly. About 20% in 10 mins or so. Now need to figure out how to reduce the high latency # (256ms) in the Xbox Networking settings. I have a pretty fast connection so this makes no sense.
